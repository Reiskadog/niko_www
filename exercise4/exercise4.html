                        <p>
                            In literary theory, a text is any object that can be "read", 
                            whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an 
                            arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. 
                            It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative 
                            message.[1] This set of signs is considered in terms of the informative 
                            message's content, rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium 
                            in which it is represented.

                        <h1>Reading</h1>
                        <p>
                            Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive 
                            meaning. It is a form of language processing.
                            Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. 
                            Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing 
                            information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) 
                            but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction 
                            between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and 
                            the language communityâ€”which is culturally and socially situated. Readers use a 
                            variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual 
                            representations of speech) and comprehend. Readers may use context clues to identify 
                            the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their 
                            existing framework of knowledge or schema.

                        <h1>Thought</h1>
                        <p>
                            Thought encompasses an "aim-oriented flow of ideas and associations that 
                            can lead to a reality-oriented conclusion".[1] Although thinking is an 
                            activity of an existential value for humans, there is still no consensus 
                            as to how it is adequately defined or understood.
                            Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, 
                            understanding its physical and metaphysical origins and its effects has 
                            been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including philosophy, 
                            linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, 
                            sociology and cognitive science.
                            Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or 
                            model the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. 
                            It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires 
                            as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.
