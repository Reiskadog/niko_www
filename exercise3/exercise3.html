        <h1>The differences between HTML & HTML5</h1>
        <p>
            HTML5 has quickly become the new standard in web-developement. The main advantages of 
            using HTML5 are: Enhanced semantic elements, maximized mobile support and more
            web application features.

            HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
            recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is 
            maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), 
            the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
            
            HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] 
            with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals 
            were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; 
            to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers 
            and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain 
            backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, 
            but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]
