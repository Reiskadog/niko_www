            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>
                The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
                The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, 
                which indicates the link's destination.
                By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A visited link is underlined and purple
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An active link is underlined and red
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Example</strong><br />
                &lt;a href="The page your link will lead to"&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt; 
                <p>

            </p>
            <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>
                The &lt;img&gt; tag defines an image in an HTML page <br />
                &lt;img&gt; tag has two required attributes: src and alt.<br />
                <b>Note: </b>Images are not technically inserted into an HTML page, images are 
                linked to HTML pages. The &lt;img&gt; tag creates a holding space for the
                referenced image.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Example</strong>
                <br />
                &lt;img src="Reference to your image location goes here." alt="alternate text for
                your image goes here."&gt;
                <p>
