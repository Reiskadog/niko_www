                    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    <h1>What is Google?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in 
                        Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising 
                        technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is 
                        considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, 
                        and Facebook.[10][11]
                        Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were 
                        Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent 
                        of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting 
                        stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, 
                        in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] An initial 
                        public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters 
                        in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced 
                        plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is 
                        Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's 
                        Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who 
                        became the CEO of Alphabet.

                    <h1>What is Reddit?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. 
                        Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which 
                        are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created 
                        boards called "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, 
                        video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes 
                        appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately 
                        on the site's front page. Despite strict rules prohibiting harassment, Reddit's administrators 
                        spend considerable resources on moderating the site.[5]
                        As of July 2019, Reddit ranks as the No. 5 most visited website in the U.S. and No. 13 in 
                        the world, according to Alexa Internet, with 55% of its user base coming from the United States, 
                        followed by the United Kingdom at 7.4% and Canada at 5.8%.[6]
                        Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. 
                        Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. In 2011, Reddit became an independent 
                        subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications.[7] In October 2014, Reddit 
                        raised $50 million in a funding round led by Sam Altman and including investors Marc Andreessen, 
                        Peter Thiel, Ron Conway, Snoop Dogg, and Jared Leto.[8] Their investment valued the company at 
                        $500 million then.[9][10] In July 2017, Reddit raised $200 million for a $1.8 billion valuation, 
                        with Advance Publications remaining the majority stakeholder.[11] In February 2019, a $300 million 
                        funding round led by Tencent brought the company's valuation to $3 billion.[12]
